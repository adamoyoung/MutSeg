- enable multiple mutations at a single position (from different cancers of course)
- enforce the idea that segments cannot cross chromosomes
- add length penalty to the segments
- deal with the boundaries between segments (median? some other form?)
- separate males and females, train classifier
- is the minimum size based on the number of mutations, or the number of mutation positions?
- figure out how to do fractional mutations (maybe represent only the numerator in uint8?)
